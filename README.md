This is an addon for the artificial MDT code. You need to generate OAuth screen credentials and use the .json file to validate, for the google YouTube API.

Once you have your .json file, you can put your playlist id in a text file, which is then placed inside a folder. Then using the Generator, either type, or choose this path by pressing the Choose DIR button.

Once the direction is chosen, press generate, and a transcript file of one of your playlists you have saved in YouTube will be created, in the format, videoid, <break>, transcript. This can then be used for searching through in the MDT python file.
